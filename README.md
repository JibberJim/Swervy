# Swervy
A node / phone based solution to bluetooth steering for Zwift

For me on an up to date Raspbian
npm install
sudo node server.js

On an up to date Android phone Chromium based or Firefox, open https://ip.address.of.pi:9999/
(it needs to be https to access the acceleromoter, you will have to get past the big warning about the SSL cert being self signed)
Start zwift and connect to the steering control.

Ride!
